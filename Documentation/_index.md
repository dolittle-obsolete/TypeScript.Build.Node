We have a common [TypeScript build package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dolittle/typescript.build.node) that bundles all the tools that we use for setting up our TypeScripts Node and Library projects.

This package provides the tools and dependencies needed for developing Node-based TypeScript applications for Dolittle with [Wallaby](https://wallabyjs.com/), [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) tasks and for running tests with [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) that's configured for the project automatically.
